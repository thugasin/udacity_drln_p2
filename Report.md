## Learning Algorithm

DDPG agent algorithm with simple replay buffer is used in this project. 
My understanding and implementation of this algorithm (including various customizations) are discussed below.

#### why choose DDPG
There are two key differences in the Reacher environment compared to the previous ['Navigation' project]:
1. **Multple agents** &mdash; The version of the environment I'm tackling in this project has 20 different agents, whereas the Navigation project had only a single agent. To keep things simple, I decided to use a single brain to control all 20 agents, rather than training 20 individual brains. Training multiple brains seemed unnecessary since all of the agents are essentially performing the same task under the same conditions. Also, training 20 brains would take a really long time!
2. **Continuous action space** &mdash; The action space is now _continuous_, which allows each agent to execute more complex and precise movements. Essentially, there's an unlimited range of possible action values to control the robotic arm, whereas the agent in the Navigation project was limited to four _discrete_ actions: left, right, forward, backward.

Given the additional complexity of this environment, the **value-based method** we used for the last project is not suitable &mdash; i.e., the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. Most importantly, we need an algorithm that allows the robotic arm to utilize its full range of movement. For this, we'll need to explore a different class of algorithms called **policy-based methods**.

Here are some advantages of policy-based methods:
- **Continuous action spaces** &mdash; Policy-based methods are well-suited for continuous action spaces.
- **Stochastic policies** &mdash; Both value-based and policy-based methods can learn deterministic policies. However, policy-based methods can also learn true stochastic policies.
- **Simplicity** &mdash; Policy-based methods directly learn the optimal policy, without having to maintain a separate value function estimate. With value-based methods, the agent uses its experience with the environment to maintain an estimate of the optimal action-value function, from which an optimal policy is derived. This intermediate step requires the storage of lots of additional data since you need to account for all possible action values. Even if you discretize the action space, the number of possible actions can be quite high. For example, if we assumed only 10 degrees of freedom for both joints of our robotic arm, we'd have 1024 unique actions (2<sup>10</sup>). Using DQN to determine the action that maximizes the action-value function within a continuous or high-dimensional space requires a complex optimization process at every timestep.

#### Actor-Critic Method
Actor-critic methods leverage the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods.

Using a policy-based approach, the agent (actor) learns how to act by directly estimating the optimal policy and maximizing reward through gradient ascent. Meanwhile, employing a value-based approach, the agent (critic) learns how to estimate the value (i.e., the future cumulative reward) of different state-action pairs. Actor-critic methods combine these two approaches in order to accelerate the learning process. Actor-critic agents are also more stable than value-based agents, while requiring fewer training samples than policy-based agents.

#### Exploration vs Exploitation(epsilon-greedy)
One challenge is choosing which action to take while the agent is still learning the optimal policy. Should the agent choose an action based on the rewards observed thus far? Or, should the agent try a new action in hopes of earning a higher reward? This is known as the **exploration vs. exploitation dilemma**.In the Navigation project, I addressed this by implementing an [ùõÜ-greedy algorithm],This algorithm allows the agent to systematically manage the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off. The agent "explores" by picking a random action with some probability epsilon `ùõú`. Meanwhile, the agent continues to "exploit" its knowledge of the environment by choosing actions based on the deterministic policy with probability (1-ùõú).

However, this approach won't work for controlling a robotic arm. The reason is that the actions are no longer a discrete set of simple directions (i.e., up, down, left, right). The actions driving the movement of the arm are forces with different magnitudes and directions. If we base our exploration mechanism on random uniform sampling, the direction actions would have a mean of zero, in turn cancelling each other out. This can cause the system to oscillate without making much progress.

Instead, we'll use the **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process**. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process adds a certain amount of noise to the action values at each timestep. This noise is correlated to previous noise, and therefore tends to stay in the same direction for longer durations without canceling itself out. This allows the arm to maintain velocity and explore the action space with more continuity.

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process itself has three hyperparameters that determine the **noise** characteristics and magnitude:
- mu: the long-running mean
- theta: the speed of mean reversion
- sigma: the volatility parameter

Of these, I only tuned sigma. After running a few experiments, I reduced sigma from 0.3 to 0.2. The reduced noise volatility seemed to help the model converge faster.

Notice also there's an epsilon parameter used to decay the noise level over time. This decay mechanism ensures that more noise is introduced earlier in the training process (i.e., higher exploration), and the noise decreases over time as the agent gains more experience (i.e., higher exploitation). The starting value for epsilon and its decay rate are two hyperparameters that were tuned during experimentation.

#### Experience Replay(replay buffer)
Experience replay allows the RL agent to learn from past experience.

As with DQN in the previous project, DDPG also utilizes a replay buffer to gather experiences from each agent. Each experience is stored in a replay buffer as the agent interacts with the environment. In this project, there is one central replay buffer utilized by all 20 agents, therefore allowing agents to learn from each others' experiences.

The replay buffer contains a collection of experience tuples with the state, action, reward, and next state `(s, a, r, s')`. Each agent samples from this buffer as part of the learning step. Experiences are sampled randomly, so that the data is uncorrelated. This prevents action values from oscillating or diverging catastrophically, since a naive algorithm could otherwise become biased by correlations between sequential experience tuples.

Also, experience replay improves learning through repetition. By doing multiple passes over the data, our agents have multiple opportunities to learn from a single experience tuple. This is particularly useful for state-action pairs that occur infrequently within the environment.

## Ideas for Future Work
Here's a list of optimizations that can be applied to the project:
1. Build an agent that finds the best hyperparameters for an agent
2. Prioritization for replay buffer
3. Paramter space noise for better exploration
4. Test shared network between agents
5. Test separate replay buffer for agents
